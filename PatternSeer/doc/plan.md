- Import pdf pages as images
    - Ask user for a path to the pattern PDf
    - Validate the pdf path and ask user again if it is invalid
    - Rasterize PDF and save into a memory stream
    - Decode images from the data in the memory stream
- Create the Chart from the images 
    - Guess which images contain chart data about the pattern layout
        - Add a confidence score to each guess
        - If no confidence score is able to meet a certain minimum threshold, alert the user and ask to enter manual mode for this step
        - If the number of guessed images does not create a grid, alert the user and ask to enter manual mode for this step
            Several patterns do not create a perfect grid of pages, my advent calendar for example. We must find an alternative method for stitching pages together
    - Guess which images contain data about the chart key
        - Add a confidence score to each guess
        - Choose the image that has the highest confidence score. If no image has a sufficiently high score, alert the user and ask to enter manual mode for this step
    - Use OCR to locate all blurbs of text in each of the images
    - Create a confidence score for each blurb based on location and content in order to guess general chart info such as stitched area, fabric info, copyright info, artist, title, etc.
